This was me fooling around in my much younger days acting like I was going to make something like Detours, while also building a disassembler specialized in finding x86/64 instruction lengths (before knowing Capstone exists), and I also at one point started making my own allocator because I couldn't figure out how to make an allocator that allocated rwx pages at that time. At this point, I mostly keep this repo around for sentimental reasons, and to sometimes look at the spreadsheet I made of x86 instruction lengths for fun.
